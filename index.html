            <p> A positive relation between confidence and effort/investment provision has been theoretically justified and practically assumed in the literature, but has not been thoroughly investigated. We test and confirm this positive relation between direct measures of confidence and choice of effort or investment. More precisely, strong overconfidence results in excess investment of effort and money, underconfidence induces insufficient effort provision and underinvestment, and moderate overconfidence leads to accurate decisions. Our experimental results can be generalized as they are based on different subject pools (financial professionals and students), media (computer-, paper-, and web-based), and types of effort (real mental effort and monetary effort, i.e. investment). </p>

            <p> Predicting workerâ€™s effort is important in many different areas, but is often difficult. Using a laboratory experiment, we test the hypothesis that confidence, i.e. person-specific beliefs about her abilities, can be used as a generic proxy to predict effort provision. We measure confidence in the domain of financial knowledge in three different ways (self-assessed knowledge, probability-based confidence, and incentive-compatible confidence) and find a positive relation with the actual provision of effort in an unrelated domain. Additional analysis shows that the findings are independent of personal traits such as gender, age, and nationality. </p>

           <p> I study the impact of contractual incentives on the behavior of mutual fund managers in annual tournaments. I show that linear contracts as opposed to concave ones induce managers to make larger risk adjustments in response to their relative performance ranks. I argue that contracts with linear fee structure directly translate the convex relationship between past fund returns and fund size into a convex relationship between past performance and managerial pay, whereas concave contracts distort this relationship and make it less convex. I also demonstrate that higher fee rates encourage fund managers to engage into annual tournaments, as they strengthen the connection between fund size and managerial pay in comparison with lower fee rates. The above results are robust to controlling for funds characteristics, such as fund size, age and turnover, as well as year- and style-fixed effects. </p>

            <p> We compare the risk preferences of Chinese students in the Netherlands with those of Dutch students in the Netherlands using three different measures for risk attitudes: self-reports, a lottery-choice task, and trading behavior in an experimental stock market. While Chinese subjects self-report to be more risk-seeking than Dutch, their claims are not supported by their decisions in the incentive-compatible lottery-choice task and their trading behavior in our experimental stock market. We discuss potential explanations for our findings, including foreign-language effects, sample selection, and the "cushion" hypothesis. </p>
